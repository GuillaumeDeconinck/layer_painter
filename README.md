# Layer Painter

Layer Painter is a addon for blender, made to bring a workflow similar to a tool like substance painter or armor paint directly inside blender.
The goal here is to provide a workflow which makes the tools mentioned above unnecessary for a lot of projects, keeping the work fully inside of blender.
